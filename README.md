# QPUWrapper
## Description
This library serves as an interface to VideoCore4 QPU so that custom user programs could be run on it. For that purpose it allows to:
- create program wrapper objects that manage easy setup of uniforms
- allocate data buffers on GPU memory available from CPU (used mainly as one or more uniforms for program output data)
- execute program in the background, so that it doesn't have to be awaited on

While creating programs for QPU is a complicated task itself, QPUWrapper aims to make at least running them as easy as possible.

## Usage
1. Include `Qpu.hpp` header in your application code. It will allow you to use library classes from `QPUWrapper` namespace.
2. Call `Qpu::getQpuWrapperInstance()` static method to get QPU wrapper's reference.
3. Allocate some buffers (if needed) using `allocateGpuBuffer()` method on wrapper object.
4. Create `QpuProgram` object that will represent your program.
5. Use double `[]` operator on program's object to setup the uniforms (first `[]` to specify program instance index, second `[]` to access certain uniform). For example to set first uniform on the second instance, use `programObject[1][0] = value;` (tip: you can use your buffer's `getGpuAddress()` method output value to set it as uniform - it will be needed for output data of your programs).
6. Call QPU wrapper's `executeProgram()` method by providing program and timeout to start program instances execution right away. To make sure all of them have finished, call `get()` on the `std::future` object you just received from wrapper (don't forget to check the result!).
7. Using QPU wrapper's `lockGpuBuffer()` method acquire data pointer accessible on CPU side to process data from any output buffer you passed to your program earlier. When you're done, call `unlockGpuBuffer()` on that buffer. And if you're not going to use it anymore, call `freeGpuBuffer()` afterwards.
8. You can re-use program wrapper objects as many times as you want, changing uniforms between executions if needed - just make sure any GPU memory buffers used as uniforms stay valid and are not locked while program is being run. There is no need for cleaning up program objects' resources, as it will be handled automatically upon their destruction.

**Important**: you can only run one program at once, even if it doesn't use all of the available QPU instances.

When your code is ready, all that's left is compiling it and linking QPUWrapper library (you need to build it first with a simple `make` command), as well as `bcm_host` library that can be found in `/opt/vc/lib` directory. Of course you need to build both your application and QPUWrapper library on the Raspberry Pi, unless you have properly set-up cross-compiler toolchain with required headers and libraries.

## Examples and tests
In *tests* directory there are some basic tests that you may run to make sure QPUWrapper is working correctly on your Raspberry Pi. After you build them with `make test`, they can be run manually or by using `perform_tests.sh` script (both require superuser privileges). If you want to see a complete example of running QPU program, `runningProgramTest.cpp` is what you're looking for.

## Licensing information of used code
This library was heavily inspired by two other projects - [VC4CV](https://github.com/Seneral/VC4CV) and *hello_fft* / *gpu_fft* of the [Raspberry Pi's firmware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/hardfp/opt/vc/src/hello_pi) repository. So heavily that, in fact, I believe it may be acknowledged as re-distribution of parts of the original code by some. Because of that I hereby attach licensing information as required by the licenses of aforementioned projects. As there is also some code licensed by Broadcom used from those repositories, I'm attaching their licensing notice as well.
